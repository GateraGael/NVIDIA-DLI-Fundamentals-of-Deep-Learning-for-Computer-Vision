# Deploying our Model: GPU Task 3

Continuing with the theme of using animals to teach applications of computer vision, the next task involves deploying a train neural network to create a simulated doggy door that only opens to dogs.
Here is the full scenario:

" Louie wants to be able to enter and exit his house without requiring a person to let him in. His roommate, a cat named Nala, hunts, and therefore sometimes brings her catch with her. Nala needs to be checked at the door. 
The solution:
We just trained a neural network model to classify dogs from cats. In this next section, you'll deploy that trained model into a simulator."
