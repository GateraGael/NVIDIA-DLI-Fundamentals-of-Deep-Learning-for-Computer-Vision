# Performance during Training: GPU Task 4

This section explains to students that training is measured by how accurately a model aligns with the real world.
The section introduces the following quantities: training loss, validation loss, and accuracy. Ideally, the values of training and validation loss should decrease from epoch to epoch, although they may jump around some. 


The three following points are made using pre trained models to teach the concepts:
* To run more training epochs on an existing model, analogous to a human learner studying more.
* To search the hyperparameter space, analogous to a human learner responding differently to a different teaching style.
* To use the results of others' research, compute, network design, and data, analogous to a human learner copying off an expert
